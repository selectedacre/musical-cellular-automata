# musical-cellular-automata
The Musical Cellular Automata was a final project in an artificial life and generative coding class. The idea was to first create a cellular automaton (or automata) and generative music in real time. The result is random every time the automata is created, giving a biological element to music. Visuals are created to engage the user. Made in Max/MSP.
